It take you one second to know (and feel) when you just made the right decision, but in order to make that first step I pass through entire nights thinking if at this point of my life I will give to myself an oportunity to start over my professional life and be the rookie again.
That and many other doubts start coming to my head, like what my family and friends where going to think, if at my age (33) are companies going to be interested in hire brand new developer, if I will have energy and focus after my high demanding job, etc.
So close to be defeated by my own mind, I decide to start making a list of the positive things I have and the rest was just history! 
Today I start my second week of the course and I am so excited that not even 9 hours of very physical job can't take my joy of opening my VS Code and pretend to myself that I am an actual developer!

*P.S. This is my first blog ever and sorry in advance for lexical errors.*
